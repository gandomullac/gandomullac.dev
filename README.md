Hello! My name is Claudio and I'm a techy based in Ferrara

I'm currently a full-time consultant in a system engineering company, however I enjoy most working on developing web apps for clients using my favorite stacks. I also teach some courses from time to time.

## This repo

My previous "blog" was an HTML file with a list of projects written in 5 minutes. The intention was to write an interesting portfolio and, at the same time, refine my skills with Laravel, CI/CD, and free serverless hosting solutions.
Initially this was a static export made through the awesome [laravel-export package](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-export), however I ended up retiring this setup for a Forge+Octane one.

This website is built using Laravel, Blade, Filament, SQLite, plain CSS & JS.
